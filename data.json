        "history": "Afghanistan has had 20 different flags since the first flag when the Hotaki dynasty which made Afghanistan independent was established in 1709.\n\nThe current flag was adopted by the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in 2004. This flag is similar to the one flown in Afghanistan during the monarchy between 1930 and 1973. The difference is the addition of the shahadah at the top of the coat of arms (seen in yellow) in the center. This flag consists of three stripes of the colors black, red, and green. This has been present on most flags of Afghanistan in the last twenty years. The center emblem is the classical emblem of Afghanistan with a mosque with its mihrab facing Mecca. [0]",
        "meaning": "According to the website of the Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington, DC: Black represents the occupation of foreigners, the Red represents the blood of freedom fighters, and the Green represents freedom and Islam. [1]\n\nAntoher meaning could be: black appeared representing the previous (monochrome) field of Afghan flags, which in turn represented the sovereign; red was possibly introduced by emir, later king, Aman Allah as a sign of modernity and progress, copied from the Soviet flag as happened also with the 1928-1929 emblem; green stood for Islam.

        "history": "Elements of the flag's design such as the double-headed eagle were borrowed from the banner of the Byzantine Empire (specifically the emblem of the Palaiologoi dynasty). The eagle was used for heraldic purposes in the Late Middle Ages by a number of noble families in Albania (it is said that Skanderbeg used it on his flag) and became the symbol of the Albanians. The Kastrioti's coat of arms, depicting a black double-headed eagle on a red field, became famous when he led a revolt against the Ottoman Empire resulting in the independence of Albania from 1443 to 1479. This was the flag of the League of Lezhë, which was the first unified Albanian state in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe symbol of the double-headed eagle was re-used by Albanian nationalists during the 19th and early 20th centuries as a symbol of their campaign for their country's independence from the Ottoman Empire. On 28 November 1912, the Albanian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in Vlora and the flag, raised by Ismail Qemal, was adopted as the symbol of the new nation. [0]",
